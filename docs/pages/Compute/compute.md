<!-- Here is where the Pillar leads can put in the main goals/principles of the Pillar -->

## Operating Principles

Prepare our technical communities to solve challenges, by fostering hand-on expertise, enabling effective technical upskilling paths, fostering collaboration on external and internal open source IP in close synergy with Microsoft product engineering, evangelizing successful and unsuccessful experiences

## Pillar Mission

Our technical community builds and runs modern cloud applications while leveraging our services and technologies.

## Pillar Scenarios

- Serverless
- Microservices & Orchestration
- Cross-Cloud / Hybrid-Cloud
- Repeatable provisioning of infrastructure and applications
- High Scale Computing / HPC / GPU assisted computing
- Service Instrumentation and Management
- High Availability / Disaster Recovery
- Architecting for Cost

## What the community does

Mainly:

- We give guidance on Deployment Tools, Computing Environment and Monitoring Tools
- We facilitate hacks and seek 3rd party hacks to attend
- We identify gaps in products and services feedback to engineering

Also:

- We identify community-driven OSS projects to contribute to
- We share patterns, lessons learned and roadmaps
- We provide reference implementations (1st or 3rd party)
- We provide links to upskilling content
- We track what's going on at conferences
- We are one global community across all CSE teams
